## rts

---

to run: use [live-server]()

- uses [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/about/)

### main todos

- use more backend validation instead of frontend validation

### NOTES:

- Victor.js is mutable, modifies vector directly unless you use `.clone()`

### 2d engines compared:

- paper js - has vector lib, lots of demos, has scenegraph, has efficient sweep+Prune collision detection https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/issues/1737
  - collisions - http://paperjs.org/reference/item/#intersects-item
- two js - focuses on animation, has basic vector lib, actively developed, has scenegraph
- pixi js - just rendering, not enough, has collision detect?
- stage js - not actively developed, no vector lib, has scenegraph

### vector engines compared:

- b/c paper JS's vector point stuff doesn't really work...
- https://github.com/evanshortiss/vector2d
- ended up using http://victorjs.org/
